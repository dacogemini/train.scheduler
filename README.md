## Train Scheduler

In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates
Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate 
this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information 
about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain 
until they arrive at their station.
